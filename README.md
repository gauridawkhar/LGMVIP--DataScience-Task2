**Using Decision Tree Algorithm for Prediction**
In this project, we implement a Decision Tree classifier to predict the class label of new data. The classifier is trained on a dataset and then visualized graphically, allowing us to understand how it makes decisions.

**Project Overview**
The Decision Tree algorithm is a valuable tool for classification tasks. In this project, we create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it to gain insights into its decision-making process. Once trained, the classifier can accurately predict the class label of new data based on its features.
